## Kanban

An intuitive kanban to organize simple task issues. You can create, read, move, and delete issues. As you can delete and create a new issue quite easily, that is to replace an edit issue function. Thus, this app fulfills CRUD, using local storage. This is a standalone HTML file that is "shippable".

### Built with
